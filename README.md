<div align="center">
  <h1>curly-funicular</h1>
  <img src="curly-funicular.png" width="70%">
</div>

## Usage
You will need to include the JavaScript file `curly-funicular.js` (or the minified version `curly-funicular.min.js`). No jQuery required!ðŸ˜Š

### Including files
Place the script in front of the closing body tag.
```html
<script src="curly-funicular.js"></script>
```

### Required HTML structure
Declare the menu with id, href links, data-cfmenuanchor menu items with the pre-defined cfactive style in this way.
```html
<div id="menu">
    <div class="cfactive" data-cfmenuanchor="first">
        <a href="#first">
            First
        </a>
    </div>
    <div data-cfmenuanchor="second">
        <a href="#second">
            Second
        </a>
    </div>
    <div data-cfmenuanchor="third">
        <a href="#third">
            Third
        </a>
    </div>
</div>
```
Each section will be defined with a div containing the data-cfanchor property. The active section by default will be the first section.
```html
<div data-cfanchor="first">Some section</div>
<div data-cfanchor="second">Some section</div>
<div data-cfanchor="third">Some section</div>
```

### Initialization
```javascript
curlyFunicular({
    menu: '#menu',
    anchors: ['#header', '#works', '#contacts'],
    offset: 200
});
```
### Accesing sections
In order to create links to a certain section, you can use a normal URL link if you are using curly-funicular with anchor links (using the `anchors` option), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain section. For example: http://example.com/index.html#page2


**Be careful!** `data-cfanchor` tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site.

### Using a menu
To link the menu with the active section you will have to make use of anchor links (#) as explained below in the options section.

## Options
- `menu`: (required) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class `cfactive`. This won't generate a menu but will just add the `cfactive` class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links. In order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, `data-cfmenuanchor` will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example:
```html
<ul id="menu">
    <li data-cfmenuanchor="first" class="cfactive">
        <a href="#first">
            First section
        </a>
    </li>
    <li data-cfmenuanchor="second">
        <a href="#second">
            Second section
        </a>
    </li>
    <li data-cfmenuanchor="third">
        <a href="#third">
            Third section
        </a>
    </li>
    <li data-cfmenuanchor="fourth">
        <a href="#fourth">
            Fourth section
        </a>
    </li>
</ul>
```
```javascript
curlyFunicular({
    menu: '#menu',
    anchors: ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth']
});
```
- `anchors`: (required) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section. **Be careful!** if you use anchors, they can not have the same value as any ID element on the site.
- `offset`: (default `0`) Determines how much you need to scroll to the next section for the menu to become active on it. Calculated as the height of the section minus the offset. It is necessary for a better user experience, especially when the user scrolls to the last section. When clicking on an anchor link, scrolling does not take into account the offset.
